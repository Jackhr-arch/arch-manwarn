.SH NAME
arch-manwarn \- check Arch Linux news for manual intervention warnings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arch-manwarn
.RI [ check ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBarch-manwarn\fR is a minimalist utility written in Rust that checks the Arch Linux news RSS feed for posts requiring manual intervention.

It is designed to be used as a pacman hook and will block package upgrades or installs if action is needed.

Its small, efficient codebase emphasizes performance and simplicity, staying out of the way unless your attention is truly required.

On first run, \fBarch-manwarn\fR assumes all existing manual interventions have already been handled.

.SH COMMANDS
